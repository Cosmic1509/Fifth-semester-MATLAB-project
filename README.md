- With the progressing software we can see the everyday advancements in image processing applications which are expanding towards the various other operations. 
In the real-time world we can observe that 2D and 3D image processing is available and its implementation is in a wide range. 
Here, we will be using MATLAB software analogy to produce and evaluate 3D images. 

- Image processing in MATLAB is very keenly heard but image simulation of videos, easy debugging, recording of the process used, numerical accuracy, and code is effortless within it. 
MATLAB provides various tasks for image processing, there are functions written within MATLAB thus, leading to easy implementation and open to scrutiny, making it different from Photoshop. 
The image processing algorithms present under MATLAB are more advanced than many editing applications.

- The techniques that are being used are video reversal, 3D image restoration, slow motion video, rendered volumes, geometric transformations, image segmentation, and video segmentation. 
Our main objective is to process 3-Dimensional(3D) images with the most recent tools and provide an empirically based method using Three Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (3D- DCT) with MATLAB-based analytics. 
The results which will be decoded can have an accurate approach to 3D image processing.
